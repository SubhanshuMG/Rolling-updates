# Automated Rolling Update Architecture for Node Operators

This architecture enables automated rolling updates for globally distributed node operators running
Docker and Docker Compose. It ensures high availability, minimizes downtime, and provides robust
monitoring and rollback mechanisms.

Note: In this repo I have added the architecture including the sample CICD with setup instructions inside the `ops-e2e-setup` folder

     Load Balancer (Optional for traffic routing across active nodes)

## Key Components
1. **Control Plane**:
- Orchestrates updates, ensures batch coordination, and monitors success.
- Tracks new Docker image versions (`bitscrunch:latest`) and triggers updates.
2. **Node Operators**:
- Distributed globally, each running an **Update Agent** for pulling new images, restarting
services, and performing health checks.
3. **Monitoring System**:
- Tracks node performance and health during updates.
- Alerts on failures or performance degradation.
- Tools: **Prometheus** and **Grafana**.
4. **Load Balancer** (Optional):
- Routes traffic to healthy nodes, ensuring high availability during updates.
---

## Update Workflow
1. **Detect New Image**:
- The Control Plane queries the Docker registry for the latest image (`bitscrunch:latest`).
- Compares the image digest with the current version on nodes.
2. **Batch Nodes**:
- Nodes are divided into batches (e.g., 10% of nodes at a time).
- Batches are updated sequentially to maintain traffic distribution.
3. **Update Nodes**:
- Nodes pull the latest image, restart services, and perform local health checks.
- If the health check fails, the process triggers a rollback.
4. **Monitor and Proceed**:
- Control Plane uses **Prometheus** to monitor the health of updated nodes.
- If all nodes in a batch succeed, the next batch begins.
5. **Rollback**:
- Nodes revert to the last known stable image in case of failure.
- Update process halts for investigation.
---

## Failure Handling

### Rollback Triggers
- Node health checks fail after an update.
- Monitoring detects degraded performance or downtime.
### Rollback Process
- The **Update Agent** restores the previous stable image version.
- Services are restarted, and traffic is redirected to unaffected nodes.
---

## Monitoring System Setup

### Prometheus
- Scrapes metrics from nodes (e.g., CPU, memory, container health).
- Example configuration:
```yaml
global:
scrape_interval: 15s
scrape_configs:
- job_name: 'node_exporter'
static_configs:
- targets: ['<node_ip>:9100']
```
### Grafana
- Provides dashboards for real-time monitoring.
- Configured alerts for issues like downtime or high error rates.

---
## Security Measures

1. **Image Integrity**:
- Use **Docker Content Trust (DCT)** to verify image authenticity.
- Validate the image with its SHA256 digest.
2. **Access Control**:
- Restrict Control Plane access to authorized personnel.
- Secure node communication using SSH with key-based authentication.
3. **Network Security**:
- Use firewall rules to limit access to nodes.
- Optional: Use a private Docker registry for better control.
---

## Scalability
- Horizontally scalable as more nodes are added globally.
- Update schedules can be regionally distributed to accommodate time zones and reduce latency.
- Optional: Implement regional Control Planes for better fault tolerance.

## Update Flow Summary
| **Step** | **Action** |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Image Detection       | Control Plane detects a new Docker image version.                                            |
| Batch Creation        | Nodes are grouped into manageable batches.                                                   |
| Update Execution      | Updates are applied to one batch at a time using the Update Agent.                           |
| Health Check          | Updated nodes perform health checks and report results.                                      |
| Monitor & Alert       | Monitoring system alerts on failures; successful updates proceed to the next batch.          |
| Rollback              | Failed nodes revert to the last stable image; updates are paused until issues are resolved.  |

## Tools
- **Docker**: Container runtime.
- **Docker Compose**: Service orchestration.
- **Prometheus**: Monitoring and alerting.
- **Grafana**: Visualization and dashboards.

## Example Node Update Script (Update Agent)
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Configuration
IMAGE="bitscrunch:latest"
HEALTH_CHECK_URL="http://localhost:8080/health"
ROLLBACK_IMAGE="bitscrunch:stable"
# Pull the latest image
docker pull $IMAGE
# Restart services with the new image
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
# Perform health check
if curl -f $HEALTH_CHECK_URL; then
echo "Update successful"
else
echo "Health check failed. Rolling back..."
docker pull $ROLLBACK_IMAGE
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
fi
```
